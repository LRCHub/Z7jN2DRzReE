We're listening to Diana Ross,
She sang her song about love hangover, love hangover.
Swing n' sway she leads our way, leads our way
Leads our way into a love hangover, a love hangover.
I didn't know what I feared
But I do know what I feel
We feel no pain with Diana Ross, she leads our way,
She leads our way, leads our way into a love hangover,
A love hangover, love hangover.
I didn't know what I feared
But I do know what I feel
Do know what I feel.
