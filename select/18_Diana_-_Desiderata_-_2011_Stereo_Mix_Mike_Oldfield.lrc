[02:28.04] You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
[02:42.79] And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
[03:26.29] 
[03:51.92] You have a right to be here
[03:59.34] No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
[04:14.98] Herefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.
[04:25.15] In the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.

[05:00.14] Child of the universe... you have a right to be here...
