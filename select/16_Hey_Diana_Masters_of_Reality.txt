Hey Diana, hey
Fly (?) side away
While in the woods today
Hey Diana, hey

Place gonna shine
?
But you're warm, comfort in here
?
?

Hey Diana, hey
I'd love for you to stay
Stand the naked me
By the laurel tree

?

Hey Diana, hey
Hey Diana, hey
Hey Diana, hey
Hey Diana, hey
Hey Diana, hey
Hey Diana, hey
Hey
