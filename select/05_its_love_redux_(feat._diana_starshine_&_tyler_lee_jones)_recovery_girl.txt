Maybe pour that drink in my cup
Tell me that, I'm yours but you just fuck me up
Is it all on me if I'm cursed by your touch
You say this is love
But I think that it's not
(We can take the best-)

I know, that when you call me up and I'm like
For sure, you don't care if it's me who shows up
Tonight, I know you'd rather not have me in
Your life, all you wanna do is fuck

Maybe pour that drink in my cup
Tell me that, I'm yours but you just fuck me up
Is it all on me if I'm cursed by your touch
You say this is love
But I think that it's not

(Recovery Girl)
I know
You'd rather not be seeing me tonight
I know
You'd rather not have me in your life
Could you just, this one time
Give a fuck about me or anyone in your life

I just want you to be
Honest with me
I just want you to be
Honest with yourself
Honest with yourself

You say this shit is love
I know it's not
The smoke and all the pills that you can pop, uh
And when we drink until the bottle's gone
Now I know this ain't love
Now I know that it's not

Maybe pour that drink in my cup
Tell me that, I'm yours but you just fuck me up
Is it all on me if I'm cursed by your touch
You say that it's love
But I think that it's not
