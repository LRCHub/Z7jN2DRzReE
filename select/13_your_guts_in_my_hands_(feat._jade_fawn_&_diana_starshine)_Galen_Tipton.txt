When you're around me (when you're around me)
Water cold, ice clean (water cold, ice clean)
When you're around me (when you're around me)
Water's cold and clean (water's cold and clean)

Your solace
The sun is (the sun is)
High (high)

Your touch is so sweet
Cold like ice (when you're around)
Cold like ice on my teeth

Like ice on my teeth
Close to me
Close to me
You're-

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
