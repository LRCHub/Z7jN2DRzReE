[00:04.10] Oh, no
[00:20.09] Oh, no
[00:24.96] Oh, no
[00:27.96] 
[00:28.68] You'll never make me stay
[00:29.99] So take your weight off of me
[00:31.65] I know your every move
[00:33.54] So won't you just let me be
[00:35.35] I've been here times before
[00:37.44] But I was too blind to see
[00:38.95] That you seduce every man
[00:40.79] This time you won't seduce me
[00:55.29] 
[00:42.55] She's saying, "That's okay
[00:44.32] Hey, baby, do what you please
[00:46.58] I have the stuff that you want
[00:48.32] I am the thing that you need
[00:49.92] She looked me deep in the eyes
[00:51.74] She touchin' me so to start
[00:53.76] She says there's no turnin' back"
[00:55.47] She trapped me in her heart
[01:08.97] 
[00:57.30] Dirty Diana, nah
[01:00.98] Dirty Diana, nah
[01:04.42] Dirty Diana, no
[01:08.32] Dirty Diana

[01:12.18] Oh, no
[01:18.11] Oh, no
[01:19.91] Oh, no
[01:22.91] 
[01:26.77] She likes the boys in the bands
[01:28.43] She knows when they come to town
[01:30.16] Every musician's fan, after the curtain comes down
[01:33.82] She waits at backstage doors, for those who have prestige
[01:37.46] Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
[02:04.96] 
[01:41.16] She's saying, "That's okay
[01:42.89] Hey, baby, do what you want
[01:44.77] I'll be your night lovin' thing
[01:46.86] I'll be the freak you can taunt
[01:48.28] I don't care what you say
[01:50.27] I wanna go too far
[01:52.33] I'll be your everything
[01:54.01] If you make me a star"
[02:05.01] 
[01:55.95] Dirty Diana, nah
[01:59.74] Dirty Diana, nah
[02:03.18] Dirty Diana, no

[02:32.34] Dirty Diana
[02:36.07] It's Dia-aa-aa... come on
[02:48.57] 
[02:54.38] She said, "I have to go home
[02:56.85] 'Cause I'm real tired you see
[02:58.07] Now I hate sleepin' alone
[02:59.77] Why don't you come with me?"
[03:01.76] I said, "My baby's at home
[03:03.87] She's probably worried tonight
[03:05.42] I didn't call on the phone
[03:07.29] To say that I'm alright"
[03:19.29] 
[03:09.34] Diana walked up to me
[03:10.96] She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
[03:12.94] And then I ran to the phone
[03:14.59] Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
[03:16.63] I said, "But unlock the door"
[03:18.22] 'Cause I forgot the key
[03:20.04] She said, "He's not coming back
[03:22.01] Because he's sleeping with me"
[03:37.01] 
[03:24.18] Dirty Diana, nah
[03:28.07] Dirty Diana, nah
[03:30.82] Dirty Diana, nah
[03:34.54] Dirty Diana, no
