Brigidine Diana
A mother of us all
I want to honor you
With this little song from Ireland's soul
For full of grace are you
The Goddess is with you
And blessed are you among all women
And the fruit of your womb,
Sweet Harry and William
Will be all mother's sons
And honor the work you've done
Your love and your compassion
Were Christ-like and were true
And British armed aggression
Is dead because of you
You've burned down Babylon
And Goddess, I for one
Thank you for what you've done
And hope I can become
Just a bit more like you
And love the way you do
I pledge that I'll try to
Goddess you've always been true
